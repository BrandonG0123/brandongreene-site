"""Finding the mat's markers in each photo, to sub-pixel precision.

The phone already finds markers live (js-aruco2, to steer the person). Here
we find them again, offline, with OpenCV, on the saved full-size photos:
there's no time pressure, so we can afford the careful version.

What a detection is
-------------------
Each marker is a 30 mm black square with a unique 6x6 pattern inside. The
pattern says *which* marker it is; the board file says where that marker is
printed on the sheet. So each detected marker gives four correspondences:
"this pixel is the image of that exact millimetre position on the paper".
Those correspondences are what turn the reconstruction into millimetres
(see scale.py).

Corner precision
----------------
A corner found to the nearest pixel is off by up to half a pixel; at a
typical phone distance one pixel is about a quarter of a millimetre on the
mat. Sub-pixel refinement fits the corner to the image gradients around it
(the intensity edges of the black square cross at the corner), which brings
the error to a small fraction of a pixel. The tests measure that error on
rendered images, where the true corner position is known exactly.

Pixel conventions
-----------------
OpenCV puts pixel *centres* at integer coordinates (the first pixel covers
-0.5..0.5). COLMAP puts pixel *corners* at integers (the first pixel covers
0..1). Mixing them silently shifts every point by half a pixel. Corners are
stored here in OpenCV's convention; ``to_colmap`` converts.
