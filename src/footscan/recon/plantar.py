"""The underside of the foot, in the foot's own coordinate frame.

After reconstruction the mesh is in *mat* coordinates: x across the paper,
y toward the toe sheet, z up. Measurements and the insole design need *foot*
coordinates (frame.py): x forward along the foot, y toward the inside
(medial), z up, origin under the back of the heel. Phase 3 will place that
frame from landmarks you click (heel, 1st and 5th metatarsal joints); this
module builds a **provisional** frame from the mesh alone, so a scan can be
looked at and roughly measured before any clicking. The report labels it
provisional, and Phase 3 replaces it.

The provisional frame
---------------------
- **Up** is the mat's z axis: in a standing or semi-standing scan, the floor
  under the foot *is* the reference plane (frame.py's ``support_plane``).
- **Forward** is the long axis of the footprint: take the part of the foot
  within ``FOOTPRINT_BAND_MM`` of the floor, flatten it onto the floor, and
  find the direction across which it is narrowest (see ``long_axis``).
  That gives a line, not a direction. Two independent clues pick the toe end:
  the mat says "toes toward sheet 2" (+y), and the leg rises above the
  *heel*, so the scan's high points (the shin) sit over the back of the
  foot. If the clues disagree, the leg wins and the report says so.
- **Medial** is up x forward (the foot's left) for a right foot, and the
  opposite for a left foot, so both feet get the same sign conventions.
- **Origin** is the rearmost point of the footprint, on the floor.

What "plantar surface" means here
---------------------------------
In a weight-bearing scan the sole is pressed on the paper and no camera
sees it. What the cameras *do* see is where the sole leaves the floor: under
the inner arch, the surface curves up from the paper and is visible from
low, inside views. So:

- ``plantar.ply``: the downward-facing part of the surface (normal pointing
  more than ``DOWNWARD_COS`` toward the floor) near the floor: the arch's
  underside and the rounded edges of the heel and forefoot.
- **Footprint outline**: where the surface meets the paper (the open edge
  the floor cut left behind), flattened onto the floor.
- **Medial arch profile**: walking forward along the foot in 2 mm steps,
  the height of the lowest surface point on the inside third of the foot.
  Where the foot touches the floor it is ~0; under the arch it rises. This
  is the shape the insole's arch is defined *relative to* (Phase 4), and for
  a flat foot it is the number that matters most, so it is reported as a
  curve, not a single value.

In a non-weight-bearing scan the sole *is* visible, and the same
downward-facing selection is the full plantar surface; but there is no floor
under the foot, so the frame must come from landmarks (Phase 3).
