# Running footscan on tank (Windows 11) at footscan.brandongreene.dev

> Not a medical device. See [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md). Putting this on the
> internet means strangers can send you photos of their feet and answers to
> health questions. **Read [HOSTING.md](HOSTING.md) first**, and keep the
> site behind Cloudflare Access (step 5) until that checklist is done.

Self-contained instructions for the machine that already serves
`brandongreene.dev` (see the site repo's `deploy/TANK-AGENT-BRIEF.md`). It
assumes that brief is done: Git installed, the site cloned to
`C:\srv\brandongreene-site`, Caddy serving it, and a Cloudflare Tunnel named
`brandongreene` running as a service.

## How it fits

```

```

- **A subdomain, not a path.** footscan is a running Python program (photo
  uploads, the studio, 3-D builds), not a folder of files, and every page
  addresses `/api/...`, `/studio/...`, `/assets/...` from the site root.
  `footscan.brandongreene.dev` needs no changes to the app and keeps its
  cookies and security rules separate from the main site.
- **Same tunnel, one more line.** No new ports, no port forwarding: footscan
  listens on `localhost:8765` only and cloudflared carries it out, exactly
  like the main site.
- **The code lives in the site repo** at `apps/footscan/` (a git subtree of
  the footscan project). `git pull` in `C:\srv\brandongreene-site` updates
  both.
- **Data lives outside the repo**, in `C:\srv\footscan-data`, so a pull can
  never touch anyone's photos.

---

## Step 1 — Python

footscan needs Python 3.12 or 3.13 on Windows (the 3-D libraries publish
Windows builds for those first). In an Administrator PowerShell:

```powershell
winget install --id Python.Python.3.13 -e
```

Reopen PowerShell, then `py -3.13 --version`.

## Step 2 — Install footscan

```powershell
cd C:\srv\brandongreene-site
git pull
cd apps\footscan
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install --upgrade pip
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e ".[recon]"
mkdir C:\srv\footscan-data -Force
```

`[recon]` adds COLMAP, MeshLab and OpenCV for building 3-D models. If one of
them has no Windows build for your Python, `pip` says which; install
Python 3.12 instead and repeat.

Check it starts (Ctrl+C to stop):

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\footscan serve --public --port 8765 --data C:/srv/footscan-data
```

In a second window:

```powershell
curl.exe -sI http://localhost:8765/ | Select-Object -First 1            # 200
curl.exe -s  http://localhost:8765/robots.txt                           # Disallow: /
```

The first start writes the **studio key** to
`C:\srv\brandongreene-site\apps\footscan\.studio_key`. It is the only way into
the studio from the internet. It is gitignored; never paste it anywhere
public.

### What `--public` does

- Nothing counts as "this computer": every request arrives through the
  tunnel, so the studio opens **only** with the studio key.
- Search engines are told to stay out (`X-Robots-Tag: noindex` on every
  response, `robots.txt` disallowing everything). Add `--allow-indexing`
  only when you decide the app should be findable.

## Step 3 — Run it as a service

tank reboots weekly; a window someone has to reopen isn't good enough. With
NSSM (already used for Caddy in the site brief):

```powershell
nssm install Footscan "C:\srv\brandongreene-site\apps\footscan\.venv\Scripts\footscan.exe" "serve --public --port 8765 --data C:/srv/footscan-data"
nssm set Footscan AppDirectory "C:\srv\brandongreene-site\apps\footscan"
nssm set Footscan AppStdout "C:\srv\footscan-data\server.log"
nssm set Footscan AppStderr "C:\srv\footscan-data\server.log"
nssm start Footscan
```

## Step 4 — Add it to the tunnel

```powershell
cloudflared tunnel route dns brandongreene footscan.brandongreene.dev
```

In `C:\Users\<user>\.cloudflared\config.yml` add one rule **above** the
final `http_status:404` line:

```yaml
ingress:
  - hostname: brandongreene.dev
    service: http://localhost:8080
  - hostname: www.brandongreene.dev
    service: http://localhost:8080
  - hostname: footscan.brandongreene.dev     # new
    service: http://localhost:8765           # new
  - service: http_status:404
```

```powershell
Restart-Service cloudflared
nslookup -type=MX brandongreene.dev     # the four eforward MX records must still be there
```

## Step 5 — Cloudflare Access (do this before sharing the link)

Until the [HOSTING.md](HOSTING.md) checklist is done (device rules, health
data, under-13s, liability), don't let the open internet send you foot
photos and health answers. Cloudflare Zero Trust (free) can put a login in
front of the subdomain:

Zero Trust dashboard → Access → Applications → **Add an application** →
Self-hosted → domain `footscan.brandongreene.dev` → policy **Allow**, rule
**Emails** → your own address (and anyone you're testing with).

Visitors then sign in with a one-time code sent to an allowed email. Remove
the application when you're ready to open it up.

## Step 6 — Verify

```powershell
curl.exe -sI https://footscan.brandongreene.dev/ | Select-Object -First 1    # 302 to Access while it's on, else 200
curl.exe -s  https://footscan.brandongreene.dev/robots.txt
```

Then on your phone: open `https://footscan.brandongreene.dev/` (camera works:
Cloudflare provides real HTTPS, no certificate warning). For the studio,
open `https://footscan.brandongreene.dev/studio/?key=<the studio key>` once;
the phone remembers it.

**Reboot tank and check again.** If footscan doesn't come back by itself, the
service isn't set up right.

## Updating

```powershell
cd C:\srv\brandongreene-site
git pull
apps\footscan\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e "apps\footscan[recon]"   # only if dependencies changed
nssm restart Footscan
```

## Good to know

- **3-D builds use the whole CPU** for several minutes each, and tank also
  runs the Minecraft server. Builds run one at a time; start them when
  nobody's playing.
- **Upload limits.** Cloudflare's free plan caps a single upload at 100 MB.
  Photos (under 8 MB each) are fine; a LiDAR model over 100 MB won't import
  through the tunnel. Import it on tank itself (`http://localhost:8765` with
  the key) instead.
- **Backups.** Everything people send is in `C:\srv\footscan-data`. Back that
  folder up; git does not, by design.
- **Nothing from tank gets committed.** Not the studio key, not the data
  folder, not the tunnel credentials.
