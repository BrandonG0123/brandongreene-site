"""Phase 3: landmarks clicked on a 3-D scan, saved with it, and turned into measurements.

The studio's viewer (web/studio/landmarks.html) shows the reconstructed
surface; you click each landmark on the skin-marker sticker you placed
(docs/phase0-protocol.md, section 3). Each complete set of clicks is a
**pick**. Picks are saved in the same JSON format ``footscan measure``
already reads (data/templates/scan_landmarks.json), so a pick is a Phase 0
scan record:

    <capture>/landmarks/pick-<n>.json

Re-picking the same scan (pick 2, 3...) without seeing the earlier clicks
is what lets the repeatability study separate *picking* error from
*capture* error, so the viewer hides earlier picks while you pick.

Coordinates are the mesh's own: for reconstructed scans that is the mat
frame (mm, z up from the paper), which also gives the floor under a
standing foot exactly. Imported LiDAR meshes have no mat, so for standing
scans you click three points on the floor beside the foot instead.

Each pick records the SHA-256 of the mesh it was clicked on. If the scan is
rebuilt, the landmarks no longer sit exactly on the new surface; the pick is
marked stale rather than silently reused.
